For this Quark/Gluon classifier I am using ParticleNetâ€™s data for Quark/Gluon jet classification available online. 
It's description can be viewed in this link: https://zenodo.org/records/3164691#.YigdGt9MHrB

The models I am using are two Graph based architectures:

1. Graph Attention Network (GAT)
2. Dynamic Graph Convolutional Neural Network (DGCNN)

Details about requirements training, testing, etc: can be found within the QG_Classifier.ipynb file in this repository.

Thanks so much for looking at my repo!
